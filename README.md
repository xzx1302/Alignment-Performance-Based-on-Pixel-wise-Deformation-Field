# Alignment-Performance-Based-on-Pixel-wise-Deformation-Field
This repository showcases the alignment results of visible and infrared image pairs captured by a UAV equipped with a corresponding dual-spectral sensor (visible and infrared) under varying altitudes and pitch angles, using a fixed deformation field for alignment.
1. **Altitude_Change_Situation**: This scenario indicates that the UAV's flight altitude has changed.
2. **Pitch_Angle_Change_Situation**: This scenario indicates that the sensor's pitch angle has changed.
3. **Altitude_Pitch_Angle_Change_Situation**: This scenario indicates that both the UAV's flight altitude and the sensor's pitch angle have changed.
