# Alignment-Performance-Based-on-Pixel-wise-Deformation-Field
This repository showcases the alignment results of visible and infrared image pairs captured by a UAV equipped with a corresponding dual-spectral sensor (visible and infrared) under varying altitudes and pitch angles, using a fixed deformation field for alignment.
